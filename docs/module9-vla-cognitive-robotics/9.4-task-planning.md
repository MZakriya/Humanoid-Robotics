# Task Planning and Symbolic Reasoning in Cognitive Robotics

## Introduction

Task planning in cognitive robotics is the process of determining sequences of actions that enable a robot to achieve specified goals in complex, dynamic environments. It involves reasoning about the current state of the world, the desired goal state, and the available actions to generate executable plans that bridge the gap between the two. Task planning integrates symbolic reasoning, knowledge representation, and real-world execution to create intelligent robotic systems capable of autonomous decision-making.

The challenge in task planning for cognitive robotics lies in managing the complexity of real-world environments where states are partially observable, actions have uncertain outcomes, and goals may be temporally extended or dynamically changing. Modern task planning approaches combine classical symbolic planning with machine learning, probabilistic reasoning, and hierarchical decomposition to handle the challenges of real-world robotic applications.

## Theoretical Foundations of Task Planning

### Classical Planning Frameworks

Classical planning provides the mathematical foundation for automated planning:

**State-Space Planning**: The classical STRIPS (Stanford Research Institute Problem Solver) framework:
```
State = <Objects, Predicates, Functions>
Action = <Preconditions, Effects>
Problem = <Initial State, Goal Conditions>
```

**PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language)**: A formal language for describing planning problems:
- Domain definitions specify available actions and their effects
- Problem instances specify initial states and goals
- Hierarchical task networks (HTNs) for structured planning

**Search-Based Planning**: Algorithms for exploring state spaces:
- Forward state-space search (progression planning)
- Backward state-space search (regression planning)
- Best-first search with heuristics

### Mathematical Foundations

**Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)**: For planning under uncertainty:
```
MDP = <S, A, T, R, γ>
```
Where S is states, A is actions, T is transition probabilities, R is rewards, and γ is discount factor.

**Partially Observable MDPs (POMDPs)**: For planning with partial observability:
```
POMDP = <S, A, T, R, Ω, O, γ>
```
Where Ω is observations and O is observation probabilities.

**Game Theory**: For multi-agent planning:
- Nash equilibria for competitive scenarios
- Cooperative game theory for collaborative planning
- Stackelberg games for leader-follower scenarios

### Planning as Inference

Planning can be viewed as a form of logical inference:

**SAT-Based Planning**: Encoding planning problems as Boolean satisfiability:
```
∃p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ SAT(Constraints)
```
Where constraints encode state transitions and goal satisfaction.

**Logic Programming**: Using Prolog or similar systems for planning:
- State transition axioms
- Goal satisfaction conditions
- Recursive planning predicates

## Hierarchical Task Planning

### Hierarchical Task Networks (HTNs)

HTNs decompose complex tasks into simpler subtasks:

**Method-Based Decomposition**:
```
Task = Method₁(Parameters) | Method₂(Parameters) | ...
```
Each method specifies how to decompose a task into subtasks.

**Operator-Based Actions**: Primitive actions that directly modify the world state.

**Task Networks**: Partially ordered sets of tasks and ordering constraints.

### Temporal Planning

**Temporal HTNs**: Incorporating time constraints into hierarchical planning:
- Temporal ordering constraints
- Resource constraints over time
