# Module 3: Kinematics

## Overview
This module covers the fundamental principles of robotics kinematics, including forward and inverse kinematics, Jacobian matrices, and practical implementation in robotic systems.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, students will be able to:
- Understand forward and inverse kinematics principles
- Apply Denavit-Hartenberg parameters for robot modeling
- Calculate Jacobian matrices for differential kinematics
- Implement kinematic solutions for robotic manipulators
- Analyze kinematic chains and their applications

This is a placeholder file for Module 3. The complete content will be developed according to the detailed specification.
